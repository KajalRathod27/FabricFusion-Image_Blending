FabricFusion, is a GUI-based application built using Python's Tkinter that allows users to blend fabric textures with print patterns to visualize custom designs. Users can upload a fabric image and a print image, choose blend modes (like overlay, multiply, screen), adjust the opacity and scale of the print, and preview the fused output in real-time. The application supports transparency handling and pattern tiling to ensure full fabric coverage, making it ideal for textile designers and enthusiasts to experiment with fabric-print combinations effortlessly.
